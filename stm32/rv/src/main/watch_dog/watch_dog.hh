 * \brief   A watch-dog exchanging "alive" messages over USART with our companion MCU (NetMCU).
 *
 *          A call message is sent periodically by this watchdog to the companion MCU.
 *          The companion MCU has to respond to each call. If a certain
 *          count of missed responses are reached, the companion MCU is reset (by reset-pin).
 *
 *          On the other side, the companion MCU will reset this MCU if there are no calls coming from this watchdog.
